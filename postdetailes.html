                <h5>2. Decide your preferred subject</h5>
                <p>
                  In primary schools, you may be responsible for teaching multiple subjects. But in the secondary schools,
                  it’s most likely that you’ll be teaching the subject in which you did your major. So, it’s your choice
                  which subject do you want to teach. It’s necessary to decide this because it will keep you on the track to

                <h5>3. Earn your bachelor degree</h5>
                <p>
                  Unlike many other professions, teaching is very strict in its requirements. It’s because we don’t want to
                  give the responsibility of educating our children to someone who doesn’t have the proper education and
                  credentials. So, getting into teaching requires a minimum degree in the first place. After that, the other
                  things come. You need a bachelor degree to become a teacher. There are also other specialized and advanced
                  degrees, but you need your bachelor degree before everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you want to be a primary teacher, then you’ll need a degree of Bachelor of Education (BEd.) But, if you
                  want to be a secondary teacher, you have to do your bachelor in your preferred subject. Your major in your
                  degree will determine which subject you’ll be teaching. Earning a bachelor degree will require 3 to 4
                  years. However, if you want to be a nursery or pre-school teacher, you don’t need a bachelor degree rather
                  a proper license and certification in teaching children.
